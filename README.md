FAQ:
  Does it work?
Yes. I have used it to to successfuly acquire/renew IPv6 using DHCPV6 following http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3315

  Why is there no activity?
Because I am not always working on this. Its just a library, there are other things to do in life.

  Is there any sample program?
There is a sample program included. This prgram dumps DHCPv6 messages from given pcap file. Please execute 
mvn -f pom2.xml package 
to build it.

Because I do not know anything about it. If you send me te format and I have spare time I will add it.

Send me an email about it, I will look at it.
